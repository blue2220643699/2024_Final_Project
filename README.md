# 2024_Final_Project
# Graduate Design Project 2024

This repository contains the code and datasets for the Graduate Design Project of 2024.

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the requirements for the Master's degree program. The project focuses on [brief description of the project, e.g., machine learning model development, data analysis, etc.]. The code provided here is intended for educational and research purposes.

## Folder Structure

- `dataset/`: Contains the datasets required to run the code. Ensure that this folder is present in the repository.
- `code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code used in this project.

## How to Run the Code

To successfully run the code provided in `code.ipynb`, follow the instructions below:

1. **Download the Dataset**: Ensure that the dataset is downloaded and placed in the `dataset/` folder.
   
2. **Place the Dataset**: The dataset must be in the same directory as `code.ipynb`. You can do this by moving or copying the `dataset/` folder to the appropriate location.

   ```bash
   mv dataset/ path/to/code.ipynb/directory/
